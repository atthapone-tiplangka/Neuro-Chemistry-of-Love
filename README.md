# 🧠 Neuro-Chemistry of Love

An interactive educational dashboard designed to explore the complex biological and chemical processes governing human mate selection, attraction, and long-term relationship formation.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Interactive Love Stages
Navigate through the four core biological stages of a relationship:
- **Baseline**: The stable resting state of emotional regulation.
- **Lust**: The instinct-driven phase powered by sex hormones and the hypothalamus.
- **Attraction**: The "honeymoon" phase characterized by dopamine-driven euphoria and serotonin-dip obsession.
- **Attachment**: The long-term bonding phase facilitated by oxytocin and vasopressin.

### 2. Parallel Neuro-Twin (Digital Twin Simulation)
A "Cyber-Physical" simulation module that mirrors real-time neurochemical fluxes based on interpersonal interactions.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks Dopamine, Oxytocin, and Cortisol.
- **Automated Recommendations**: Triggering stress-mitigation alerts when Cortisol levels spike.
- **Temporal Flux Visualization**: A dynamic line chart (simulating Matplotlib) showing chemical trends over time.

### 3. Neural Activity Map
A reactive brain visualizer that highlights specific regions activated during different stages of love, such as the Frontal Cortex, the Reward System (VTA/NA), and the Hypothalamus.

### 4. AI Research Explorer (Neuro-Bot)
An intelligent assistant powered by the Gemini 3 Flash model with Google Search grounding.
- **Voice Transcription**: Speak your queries directly into the interface.
- **Grounded Responses**: Answers are verified against current scientific trends via Google Search.
- **TTS Feedback**: Listen to detailed scientific explanations synthesized by the Gemini TTS engine.

### 5. Transition Analysis
Data-driven line charts and radar plots that visualize how neurotransmitter levels evolve as a relationship matures.
